### Create Network Firewall

1. Go to **Security > Network Firewall**.
2. Select all required items and click **Create Network Firewall** at the bottom.
    * RBAC: Grant API permissions to query instance objects and provide the Network Firewall service
    * Creation Type: Select either a single configuration or redundanct configuration.
    * VPC: VPC that Network Firewall will use
    * Subnet: Subnet that Network Firewall uses to control internal traffic
    * NAT: Subnet that Network Firewall uses to control external traffic
    * External transmission: Subnet that sends traffic and logs created by Network Firewall
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.07.12/nfw_add.png" height="60%">


>[Note]
> 
>* The created Network Firewall is not exposed in usersâ€™ projects.
>* Subnet, NAT, and the subnet used for external transport must all be selected as different subnets.
>   * It is recommended to create subnets in the minimum unit (28 bits) that can be created in the NHN Cloud console.
>* An Internet gateway must be connected to the routing table of the VPC to which the Network Firewall will belong before it can be created.
>* Network Firewall is provided with redundancy by separating availability zones.
>* If you use the Network Firewall service as a separate service from Security Groups, you must allow both to access the instances.
>* The CIDR block owned by Network Firewall and the CIDR block requiring connectivity must not overlap.
>* IPs created with the Virtual_IP type **in Network > Network Interface**are used by Network Firewall for redundancy purposes, so deleting them may block communication.
>* After you create a Network Firewall by selecting a single or redundant configuration, you can change the configuration on the **Option** tab if you need to make changes.

### Connection Settings
> [Example]
When the VPC (Hub) used by Network Firewall is 10.0.0.0/24, and the VPC (Spoke) that needs to be connected to the Network Firewall is 172.16.0.0/24.

1. Go to **Network > Routing**, select the Spoke VPC, and change the routing table.
    * After selecting Spoke VPC, click **Change Routing Table** to change to the Centralized Virtual Routing (CVR) method.

<br>

2. Go to **Network > Peering Gateway** to create a peering.
    * If the Spoke VPC is a different project, create a project peering.
    * If the Spoke VPC is in a different region, create a region peering.
    * If the spoke VPCs are the same project, create a peering.
        * For more information on connecting a peering gateway, please see the [](https://docs.nhncloud.com/ko/Network/Peering%20Gateway/ko/console-guide/)user guide[](https://docs.nhncloud.com/ko/Network/Peering%20Gateway/ko/console-guide/).
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings3.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings4.png" height="65%" />
<br>

3. Go to **Network > Routing**, select a Hub VPC, and set up the routing as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings5.png" height="65%" />
<br>

4. Go to **Network > Routing*, select a Spoke VPC, and set up the routing as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings6.png" height="65%" />
<br>

5. Go to **Network > Peering Gateway > Project Peering**.
    * Select the created peering and go to the **Route** tab.
    * Click the **Peer** or **Change Local Route** to set up routing as follows.
        * Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
       * Gateway: NetworkFirewall\_INF\_TRAFFIC\_VIP
        <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings7.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings8.png" height="50%" />

Once the above routing settings are complete, instances in the Spoke VPC will be able to communicate publicly through the Network Firewall. (Requires adding NAT in **Network Firewall > NAT**)
<br>

***
<br>

**If the Spoke VPC has two or more subnets and traffic control between subnets is required through Network Firewall**, add the routing as follows.

> [Example]
> When the subnets of Spoke VPC (172.16.0.0/24) are 172.16.0.0/25 and 172.16.0.128/25

* Go to **Network > Routing**, and select Spoke VPC and add the two routings as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/25 and 172.16.0.128/25
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings9.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings10.png" height="65%" />
Once the above routing settings are complete, private communication between subnets within the Spoke VPC can be made through the Network Firewall. (Requires adding a policy in**Network Firewall > Policies** tab)
<br>

***
<br>

**If there are two or more spoke VPCs**, add the routing as follows.

> [Example]
> With Spoke VPC1 (172.16.0.0/24) and Spoke VPC2 (192.168.0.0/24)

* Go to **Network > Routing** to select a Hub VPC, and add the two routings as follows.
    * Spoke VPC 1
        * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24
        * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added between Hub VPC and Spoke VPC1
    * Spoke VPC 2
        * Destination CIDR: 192.168.0.0/24
        * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added between Hub VPC and Spoke VPC1
        <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings11.png" height="65%" />


> [Note]
> VPC peering between Spoke VPC2-Hub also requires the Add Route setting, as shown in **5****in Connection Settings**.

After the above routing settings are completed, communication between different Spoke VPCs can be private through Network Firewall.(Requires adding a policy in **Network Firewall > Policy**)
Please refer to the Network Firewall service configuration diagram to set up the connection according to your environment.
<br>

Once you've created Network Firewall and established a connection, you can leverage the many features of Network Firewall to configure access control.
<br>


## Policy
When you create Network Firewall, you will be moved to the initial policy page.

In the **Policies** tab, you can manage policies to control inbound/outbound traffic and traffic between the VPCs connected to your Network Firewall.

### Main Page

* The default-deny policy is a required policy and cannot be modified or deleted.

>[Note]
> Logs blocked through the default-deny policy can be viewed on the **Log** tab after changing the **Default Blocking Policy Log Setting**to **Enable**on the **Options** tab.

![main_page.PNG](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.09.07/main_page_1.png)

### Add Policy

* Add policies based on departure, destination, and destination port.
    * Select the departure, destination, and destination port through already created objects.
* Add a policy by setting up options such as the policy's status (enabled/disabled), action (allowed/blocked), schedule, and logging per policy.
* The schedule feature works after enabling the policy's status (If the policy's status is disabled, the schedule feature does not apply).

> [Note]
>
> * Create an object by simply referencing the instance's name and private IP address, regardless of instances (once created, manage on the Object tab).


### Batch Download of Objects

* Download all IPs and port objects created in the **Object** tab at once.

## NAT

In the **NAT** (Network Address Translation) tab, select and connect a dedicated public IP with the instance to be accessed from the outside.

>[Note]
> 
> * NAT offers only destination-based and 1:1 methods.
> * Port-based NAT is not provided.
> * After creating a NAT, you must add an allow policy to enable authorized communication.
> * If you assign a floating IP directly to an instance that owns a private IP after NAT has been set up, there may be communication issues.
> * After deleting NAT, delete the unused public IP before NAT directly from **Network - Floating**.

### Add

* Click **Add** to create NAT.
    * For the public IP before NAT, select one of the pre-created IPs in **Network - Floating IP**.  
    * For the objects to be selected in Private IP after NAT, pre-create them on the **Objects** tab to add by clicking **Add**. 

![nat_add.PNG](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.04.05/nat_add_2.png)

>[Note]
> 
> * Instances can be accessed from the pre-NAT public IP that you set when adding NAT (Not required to connect a floating IP directly to the instance).

### Modify

* Click **Modify** to modify the created NAT.
    * You can modify both public and private IPs.

### Delete

* Click **Delete** to delete the created NAT.

    * Floating IPs that are not used appear in the list created in **Network > Floating IP**.

![fip.PNG](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.05.27/fip.png)

### Create Tunnel

* Create a tunnel to connect with the peer device.

![tunnel_add.PNG](https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.05.27/tunnel_add.png)

* Set up Tunnel
    * Gateway: On the Gateway tab, the created gateways appear, and select the gateway you want to associate with the tunnel.
        * If no gateways are created, they are not exposed.
    * Peer IP address: Enter the IP address of the peer VPN equipment to connect to.
    * IKE version: Set to the same version as the peer VPN equipment.
        * IKE version 1 is only supported in Main Mode.
    * Pre-Shared Key: Enter the same key value as the peer VPN equipment.
    * DPD(dead peer detection): Attempts a total of five retransmissions in 10-second increments and only supports responses to DPD requests from peer VPN equipment when Disabled is selected.
    * NAT-Traversal: Prevents packet dropping that occurs during tunnel creation and is typically enabled when the peer VPN equipment is a public IP.
* Set Phase 1/2
    * Enter the necessary setup information to create an IPSec VPN tunnel.

 > [Precautions for Setup]
 >
 > * Set all settings identically to the peer VPN equipment.
 > * The local ID is optional, depending on how the peer VPN equipment is set up.
 > * You can add up to three Phase 2s.
 > * Set the private IP for Phase 2 to /24 bits or less; if you need to set a value higher than /24 bits, check the subnet range in advance and enter it as the starting IP for the subnet.
 >   * [Example]
 >       * 192.168.100.0/20 (X) â†’ 192.168.96.0/20 (O)
 >       * 172.16.30.0/21 (X) â†’ 172.16.24.0/21 (O)
 >       * 10.0.50.0/22 (X) â†’ 10.0.48.0/22 (O)
 > * The local private IP and peer private IP must not overlap each other. This range includes all private bands that connect to Network Firewall, including VPC peering.
  > * The CIDRs below cannot be added to local private IPs and peer private IPs, and if they are, there may be issues with communication through Network Firewall.
 >   * 10.0.0.0/8
 >   * 172.16.0.0/12
 >   * 192.168.0.0/16


### Connect Tunnel

* When the tunnel is created, it will be created as a pending connection, and you can click **Connect** to connect the created tunnel to the peer VPN equipment.

> [Note]
>
> * In the **Status** column, you can see the status of the tunnel by color.
 >   * Green: Healthy connection with the peer VPN equipment
 >   * Red: Connection between peer VPN devices fails due to issues with settings or communication status.
 >   * Gray: Waiting for connection (newly created tunnel)
 >   * Orange: Click **Stop** to stop the connection between the peer VPN equipment.

### Modify Tunnel

* Click **Modify** to modify the tunnel.
    * All of these values can be modified except the Gateway, and if you do, you must also modify the peer VPN devices to the same values.

### Stop Tunnel

* Click **Stop** to stop the tunnel.
    * If you stop, private communication over the peer VPN device will be stopped. 

### Delete Tunnel

* Click **Delete** to delete the tunnel.

### Event

* You can search event logs that occur during tunnel connections with peer VPN devices.

> [Note]
>
> * Under Events, you can only search the event log for the tunnel.
> * Check the **Log** tab for logs of communication over the VPN tunnel or audit logs, such as tunnel creation and deletion.


## Log

In the **Log** tab, search logs created in Network Firewall.

### Search

* Network Firewall configuration: You can set how Network Firewall is configured: single or redundant.

> [Note]
> 
> * Changing your configuration takes a few minutes and may impact your service until the configuration change is complete.
> * It is recommended to make changes to Network Firewall, such as changing policies and NAT after configuration changes are complete.

* Network Firewall Deletion: You can delete a running Network Firewall.
    * Network Firewall can be deleted from the Korea (Pangyo) region and Korea (Pyongchon) region respectively.

> [Precautions when deleting]
> 
> * If you are deleting a running Network Firewall, consider other services associated with the Network Firewall before proceeding.     

## Disable Service

You can disable the Network Firewall service in **Project Management > Services in Use**.

> [Notes]
> 
> * Disabling the Network Firewall service applies to both the Pangyo and Pyeongchon regions.
> For example, if you enable the Network Firewall service for both the Pangyo and Pyeongchon regions of the same project, you cannot disable the Network Firewall service for only one of the two regions. 
* To disable, delete Network Firewall from the Korea (Pangyo) region and Korea (Pyeongchon) region before proceeding.
