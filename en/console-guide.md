### Create Network Firewall

1. Go to **Security > Network Firewall**.
2. Select all required items and click **Create Network Firewall** at the bottom.
    * RBAC: Grant API permissions to query instance objects and provide the Network Firewall service
    * Configuration type: Select a single configuration and configure redundancy.
    * VPC: VPC that Network Firewall will use
    * Subnet: Subnet that Network Firewall uses to control internal traffic
    * NAT: Subnet that Network Firewall uses to control external traffic
    * External transmission: Subnet that sends traffic and logs created by Network Firewall
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.09.12/create.png" height="60%" />


> [Notes before Creation]
>* The created Network Firewall is not exposed in usersâ€™ projects. 
>* The subnets used for subnet, NAT, and external transmission must all be selected as different subnets.
>   * It is recommended to create subnets in the minimum unit (28 bits) that can be created in the NHN Cloud console.
>* An Internet gateway must be connected to the routing table of the VPC to which the Network Firewall will belong before it can be created.
>* If you use the Network Firewall service as a separate service from Security Groups, you must allow both to access the instances.
>* The CIDR block owned by Network Firewall and the CIDR block requiring connectivity must not overlap.
>* IPs created with the Virtual_IP type **in Network > Network Interface**are used by Network Firewall for redundancy purposes, so deleting them may block communication.
>* After you create Network Firewall by selecting a single or redundancy configuration, you can change the configuration on the **Options** tab if you need to make changes. However, availability zones cannot be changed, so for redundancy configurations, configure separate availability zones whenever possible. 

### Connection Settings

> [Example]
When the VPC (Hub) used by Network Firewall is 10.0.0.0/24, and the VPC (Spoke) that needs to be connected to the Network Firewall is 172.16.0.0/24.

1. Go to <strong>Network > Routing</strong>, select the Spoke VPC, and change the routing table.
    * After selecting Spoke VPC, click <strong>Change Routing Table</strong> to change to the Centralized Virtual Routing (CVR) method.

<br>

2. Go to <strong>Network > Peering Gateway</strong> to create a peering.
    * If the Spoke VPC is a different project, create a project peering.
    * If the Spoke VPC is in a different region, create a region peering.
    * If the spoke VPCs are the same project, create a peering.
        * For more information on connecting a peering gateway, please see the [User Guide](https://docs.nhncloud.com/ko/Network/Peering%20Gateway/ko/console-guide/).
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings3.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings4.png" height="65%" />
<br>

3. Go to <strong>Network > Routing</strong>, select a Hub VPC, and set up the routing as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings5.png" height="65%" />
<br>

4. Go to <strong>Network > Routing</strong>, select a Spoke VPC, and set up the routing as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings6.png" height="65%" />
<br>

5. Go to <strong>Network > Peering Gateway > Project Peering</strong>.
    * Select the created peering and go to the **Route** tab.
    * Click the **Peer** or **Change Local Route** to set up routing as follows.
        * Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
        * Gateway: NetworkFirewall_INF_TRAFFIC_VIP
        <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings7.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings8.png" height="50%" />

Once the above routing settings are complete, instances in the Spoke VPC will be able to communicate publicly through the Network Firewall. (Requires adding NAT in <strong>Network Firewall > NAT</strong>)
<br>

***
<br>

**If the Spoke VPC has two or more subnets and traffic control between subnets is required through Network Firewall**, add the routing as follows.

> [Example]
When the subnets of Spoke VPC (172.16.0.0/24) are 172.16.0.0/25 and 172.16.0.128/25

* Go to <strong>Network > Routing</strong>, and select Spoke VPC and add the two routings as follows.
    * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/25 and 172.16.0.128/25
    * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added after peering connection
    <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings9.png" height="65%" />
<br>
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings10.png" height="65%" />
Once the above routing settings are complete, private communication between subnets within the Spoke VPC can be made through the Network Firewall. (Requires adding a policy in<strong>Network Firewall > Policies</strong> tab)
<br>

***
<br>

**If there are two or more spoke VPCs**, add the routing as follows.

> [Example]
With Spoke VPC1 (172.16.0.0/24) and Spoke VPC2 (192.168.0.0/24)

* Go to <strong>Network > Routing</strong> to select a Hub VPC, and add the two routings as follows.
    * Spoke VPC 1
        * Destination CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24
        * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added between Hub VPC and Spoke VPC1
    * Spoke VPC 2
        * Destination CIDR: 192.168.0.0/24
        * Gateway: Gateway of peering type added between Hub VPC and Spoke VPC1
        <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/23.12.19/ConnectionSettings11.png" height="65%" />


> [Note]
VPC peering between Spoke VPC2-Hub also requires the Add Route setting, as shown in **5****in Connection Settings**.

<br>

After the above routing settings are completed, communication between different Spoke VPCs can be private through Network Firewall.(Requires adding a policy in <strong>Network Firewall > Policy</strong>)
Please refer to the Network Firewall service configuration diagram to set up the connection according to your environment.
<br>

***

## Connect to Instance
After creating Network Firewall and complete all connection settings, you can access your instance through the Network Firewall.

For example, if you configure 3 subnets with 2 Spoke VPCs in 1 project and need web firewall access from outside, set up NAT and ACLs as shown below.

<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.09.12/instance-access
.png" height="65%" />

> [How to set up]
> * Go to **Network Firewall > NAT** tab
> * Click **Add** and set up NAT
>   * Create a Destination IP object on the **Objects** tab before setup and need a spare floating IP 
> <img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.09.12/nat-add.png" height="65%" />
* Allow the required ACLs on the **Network Firewall > Policies > ACLs** tab
<img src="https://kr1-api-object-storage.nhncloudservice.com/v1/AUTH_2acdfabf4efe4efc8a04c00b348110c9/cdn_origin/prod_nfw/24.09.12/access_acl.png" height="65%" />

        * If no gateways are created, they are not exposed.
    * Peer IP address: Enter the IP address of the peer VPN equipment to connect to.
    * IKE version: Set to the same version as the peer VPN equipment.
        * IKE version 1 is only supported in Main Mode.
    * Pre-Shared Key: Enter the same key value as the peer VPN equipment.
    * DPD(dead peer detection): Attempts a total of five retransmissions in 10-second increments and only supports responses to DPD requests from peer VPN equipment when Disabled is selected.
    * NAT-Traversal: Prevents packet dropping that occurs during tunnel creation and is typically enabled when the peer VPN equipment is a public IP.
* Set Phase 1/2
    * Enter the necessary setup information to create an IPSec VPN tunnel.

 > [Precautions for Setup]
 > * Set all settings identically to the peer VPN equipment.
 > * The local ID is optional, depending on how the peer VPN equipment is set up.
 > * You can add up to three Phase 2s.
 > * Set the private IP for Phase 2 to /24 bits or less; if you need to set a value higher than /24 bits, check the subnet range in advance and enter it as the starting IP for the subnet.
 >   * [Example]
 >       * 192.168.100.0/20 (X) â†’ 192.168.96.0/20 (O)
 >       * 172.16.30.0/21 (X) â†’ 172.16.24.0/21 (O)
 >       * 10.0.50.0/22 (X) â†’ 10.0.48.0/22 (O)
 > * The local private IP and peer private IP must not overlap each other. This range includes all private bands that connect to Network Firewall, including VPC peering.
  > * The CIDRs below cannot be added to local private IPs and peer private IPs, and if they are, there may be issues with communication through Network Firewall.
 >   * 10.0.0.0/8
 >   * 172.16.0.0/12
 >   * 192.168.0.0/16

### Connect Tunnel

* When the tunnel is created, it will be created as a pending connection, and you can click **Connect** to connect the created tunnel to the peer VPN equipment.

> [Note]
> * In the **Status** column, you can see the status of the tunnel by color.
 >   * Green: Healthy connection with the peer VPN equipment
 >   * Red: Connection between peer VPN devices fails due to issues with settings or communication status.
 >   * Gray: Waiting for connection (newly created tunnel)
 >   * Orange: Click **Stop** to stop the connection between the peer VPN equipment.
> * After the tunnel creation is complete, depending on the type of peer device and its settings, you may not need to click **Connect** to connect.

### Modify Tunnel

* Click **Modify** to modify the tunnel.
    * All of these values can be modified except the Gateway, and if you do, you must also modify the peer VPN devices to the same values.

### Stop Tunnel

* Click **Stop** to stop the tunnel.
    * If you stop, private communication over the peer VPN device will be stopped. 

### Delete Tunnel

* Click **Delete** to delete the tunnel.

### Event

* You can search event logs that occur during tunnel connections with peer VPN devices.

> [Note]
> * Under Events, you can only search the event log for the tunnel.
> * Check the **Log** tab for logs of communication over the VPN tunnel or audit logs, such as tunnel creation and deletion.


## Log

In the **Log** tab, search logs created in Network Firewall.

### Search

* Traffic: Search traffic logs generated by allow or block policies when passing through the Network Firewall.
    * You can search only historical data up to 3 months in 1-month increments.
        * The maximum number of stored logs is 8 million, and the amount of logs stored depends on the amount of traffic, so past data may not be retrieved.
    * If separate data storage is required, see the **log remote transmission settings** in the **Options** tab.

* Audit: Search logs for changes to Network Firewall, including policy creation and deletion.
    * You can search for up to one month, and can search through CloudTrail, an organizational service.

### Download Excel

* Download traffic and audit log search results through **Download Excel**.
    * The maximum number of downloads in a traffic log is 300,000.

## Monitor

In the **Monitor** tab, check the status of Network Firewall in real time.
Searches are only available for up to 24 hours (1 day).

### Search

* Sessions: Quantity of sessions currently in use through Network Firewall.
* Network Usage: Inbound/outbound traffic currently passing through Network Firewall

## Options

In the **Options** tab, set options required for operation of Network Firewall.

### Log Settings

* Default blocking policy log settings: Select whether to save the default blocking policy log that is required after creating a Network Firewall.
    * When enabled, you can search logs created with the default blocking policy in the traffic log.
